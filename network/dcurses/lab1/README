For dcurses_start_fullscreen(), I declared static struct termios stored as global variable
"stored" stores the very original termios things.
In dcurses_start_fullscreen(), it gets terminal options from "stored" with using tcgetattr()and copy to the termios "new". (new = stored)
And with cfmakeraw(), set raw mode for new.
Finally set current termios as "new" (tcsetattr(0,TCSANOW,&new))

For dcurses_end_fullscreen(), I use the "stored" to reset current termios.
It clears the screen with dcurses_clearScreen(); and move cursor to left top corner.

For dcurses_setFont(),dcurses_fg,dcurses_bg I use nested if.

Since there are a lot of options for pallet color, I use not "nest if" but %d for dcurses_bg_pallet(), dcurses_fg_pallet().

For disable blink and reverse, I use printf("\e[0m"), which makes all of attributes reset.


For dcurses_location, I use similar method for dcurses_start_fullscreen().
To get the location of cursor, I have to call printf("\e[6n"); scanf("\e[%d;%dR",y,x);
But, the terminal echos "\e[%d;%dR",which I don't want to see.
So, set the terminal as raw and then call printf("\e[6n"); scanf("\e[%d;%dR",y,x); and then reset the terminal.

For dcurses_moveTo(), I use printf("\e[%d;%dH",y,x)


For dcurses_bounds, I move the cursor extremely far away.
And then the cursor will be at right bottom corner.
Get the position of cursor and the position(x,y) is (width,height) of this window.
